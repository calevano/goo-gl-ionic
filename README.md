I wanted to shorten urls for the social network Twitter, but did not want to go to a website and do this manually , you could use an API of bitly or another, but I wanted to make it simple, that when you click share by Cordova plugin " SocialSharing " and thus be able to shorten my share without drawbacks twitter.
